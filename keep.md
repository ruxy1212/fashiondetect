# Meaning of Iteration
Loading Data: The training script loads a batch of training samples from the dataset. Each sample typically consists of an image and its associated annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, class labels).

Forward Pass: The loaded batch of samples is passed through the neural network model (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) to compute predictions for the objects present in the images.

Loss Computation: The model predictions are compared to the ground truth annotations to compute a loss value that quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and actual object properties (e.g., bounding box coordinates, class probabilities).

Backward Pass (Gradient Calculation): The gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters (weights) are computed using backpropagation.

Parameter Update (Optimization): The optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) updates the model parameters using the computed gradients to minimize the loss function.

Logging and Monitoring: Optionally, training metrics such as loss values, accuracy, and other performance metrics may be logged or monitored to assess the training progress.

# Difference between iteration and epoch in Detectron2
In Detectron2, one iteration does not necessarily equate to one epoch. An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset, whereas an iteration typically refers to one update step during training, which may involve processing one or more batches of data.

Let's clarify the relationship between iterations, epochs, and batch size in the context of your training setup:

Iteration: An iteration in Detectron2 typically represents one update step of the model parameters using one batch of training data. In your case, with a batch size of 2, each iteration would process and update the model based on two images.

Epoch: An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. Since you have 45,000 images in your training dataset and a batch size of 2, it would take 45,000 / 2 = 22,500 iterations to complete one epoch. This means that the training process would need to iterate over the dataset 22,500 times to complete one epoch.

In summary, in your training setup:

One iteration processes one batch of training data (2 images).
One epoch involves iterating over the entire training dataset (45,000 images) once, which would require 22,500 iterations.
It's important to note that the number of epochs determines how many times the model sees the entire training dataset during training. Typically, training continues for multiple epochs until the model converges to a satisfactory level of performance or until a stopping criterion is met.
